Project Name: Counter App

Description:
The Counter App is a simple web application developed using the Next.js framework. The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly counter application that allows users to increment and decrement a counter value. The project showcases fundamental concepts of web development, including React components, state management, and basic styling.

Features:
1. Increment and Decrement: Users can click the "Increment" button to increase the counter value and the "Decrement" button to decrease it. The counter value cannot go below zero.

2. Styling: The app features a clean and modern design. The counter value and buttons are styled using SCSS (Sass), providing an improved user interface.

3. Responsive Layout: The app is designed to be responsive and is centered both horizontally and vertically on the screen. It adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining a consistent design.

4. Global Styling: Global styling is applied using the `_app.js` file, ensuring consistent styles across all components. The global styles include a background color, giving the app a cohesive look.

5. Component Modularity: The app is structured using React components, making it easy to understand and maintain. Components are well organized and follow best practices for component-based development.

Usage:
1. To run the project, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd counter-app
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the Counter App.

Project Structure:
The `pages/` directory Contains the main components for the app, including the `index.js` file, which serves as the main entry point.
The `styles/` directory Holds the SCSS (Sass) styling files for the app, including `variables.scss` for defining styling variables and `styles.scss` for the main styling code.

Future Enhancements:
The Counter App can be further enhanced by incorporating additional features such as:
persisting the counter value using browser storage or a backend database.
Adding animations or transitions for a more engaging user experience
Implementing more complex state management solutions like Redux
